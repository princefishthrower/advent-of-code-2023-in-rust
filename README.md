# Advent of Code 2023... With Rust!

My feeble attempt to learn some rust. Despite the author's wishes, I AM using ChatGPT as a tool to help me learn rust.

# Build the project

```shell
cargo build
```

# Running the solutions

Each day is seperated into a folder by number, i.e. simply `1/`, `2/`, etc. They also have the puzzle input if given for that day. To run the solution, simply run:

```shell
cargo run --bin 1
cargo run --bin 2
// etc
```
